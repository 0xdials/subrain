# subrain

crappy bash script that automates subdomain enumeration. relies heavily on tools written by wiser hackers.


## dependencies

sublist3r
assetfinder
httprobe
anew
probably more by the time this is done.

## usage

```
./subrain.sh <input_file>
```

where ""input_file" is a list of subomains you want to enumerate, seperated by newline
